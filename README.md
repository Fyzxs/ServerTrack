Example Project
This is an example project to Monitor Server status. A weekend project one might call it.

This is written in C# 6 using Visual Studio 2015 targeting .NET 4.6.1. C# 6 is required because I find the "Expression Body" pretty clean.

Preparation to Run:
    For simplicity; it'll be assumed that a copy of Visual Studio 2015 is available.
    A Browser is available and/or Fiddler (or Charles for the mac-olytes)

Running:
    Open the ServerTrack.sln in Visual Studio. There will be 2 projects; Primary and Unit Tests.

    The primary project is "ServerTrack". This contains the end points for recording a server load and for displaying the average information for a server.

    From what ever your prefered "Start" method is out of visual studio; start the project. It is set as the StartUp project.

Started:
    This should start the project; and likely (configuration dependant, but does by default) open a browser.

ServerLoads:
    To provide a serverload; the URL must have the following path
        api/v1/record/{serverName}/cpu/{cpuLoad}/ram/{ramLoad}/
    where {serverName} is a string and {cpuLoad} and {ramLoad} are doubles

    Make GET requests to the url and the data will be stored and averaged for the server specified

    All entries with the same servername will be computed together.

    It is very important that the record load url end in a slash. Any doubles that have a decimal point will not work. This wasn't detected until late in the flow; and not enough time to correct it.
    Lame, I know - but a weekend project isn't going to hit all the edge cases perfectly.


Display Data:
    To display data; the url most have the following path
        api/v1/display/{serverName}
    The result will be a json string looking something like
        {"ServerName":"testServer","MinuteResolutionLoads":{"CpuLoad":[76.12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,76.0],"RamLoad":[53.12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,53.0]},"HourResolutionLoads":{"CpuLoad":[25.35],"RamLoad":[17.69]}}
