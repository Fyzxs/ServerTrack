I'm going to try to put all the assumptions I'm making into this file for an easy resource to point to for explanation of decisions. If I make an assumption without thinking about it; it'll 
probably not get put into this file.

Storing Load Values
    Only an accurate average of the provided values needs to be stored; not all of the values provided. This is a memory optimization; and a "don't do silly things" decision.

Server Name Assumptions
    The value provided is unique to a server; the same name means it's the same server as the rest.

CPU Load Assumptions
    The value provided is some calculation over all the CPU's and cores to provide a single representation. 
        I feel this is a valid assumption, not just for this project, but for an actual implementation of this as only the host-server will know the exact configuration and be able to 
        make intelligent choices. Any aggregation done to resolve it to a single number on the tracking server will require assumptions that may not be true, causing incorrect weighting
        of the information being provided.
    The value is the calculated single value for CPU utilization for the reporting period.
    The value is a percentage. 
        Non-percentages wouldn't be particularly informative across non-identical systems.

RAM Load Assumptions
    The value provided represents the amount of RAM currently used; or RAM_TOTAL - RAM_FREE.
        Because RAM used specifies the load.
    The value is a percentage.
        Non-percentages wouldn't be particularly informative across non-identical systems.
